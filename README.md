- A **Database** that contains all the info regarding the poll made to participants and all they personal information. 
- An **API** that returns all the information about the jobs of the participants in the poll.
- A complete ISO 3166-1 encoding list from **Wikipedia** of all the world countries.

## **Inputs:**
*Last but not least, by writing your README soon you give yourself some pretty significant advantages. Most importantly, youâ€™re giving yourself a chance to think through the project without the overhead of having to change code every time you change your mind about how something should be organized or what should be included.*

### **Status**: WIP
This is the first part of the Ironhack Data Analytics Final Project.

### **Technology stack**
Python, Pandas, Scipy, Scikit-learn, etc. Indicate the technological nature of the software, including primary programming language(s), main libraries and whether the software is intended as standalone or as a module in a framework or other ecosystem.

### :boom: **Core technical concepts and inspiration**
Why does it exist? Frame your project for the potential user. Compare/contrast your project with other, similar projects so the user knows how it is different from those projects. Highlight the technical concepts that your project demonstrates or supports. Keep it very brief.

### :wrench: **Configuration**
Requeriments, prerequisites, dependencies, installation instructions.

### :see_no_evil: **Usage**
Parameters, return values, known issues, thrown errors.

### :shit: **ToDo**
Next steps, features planned, known bugs (shortlist).

### :information_source: **Further info**
Credits, alternatives, references, license.

### :love_letter: **Contact info**
Getting help, getting involved, hire me please.
